### RailsConf CRUD app demo. Full tutorial coming soon!

-----------------------------

#### Branch flow

There branchs for each step of CRUD--they build upon each other

- r-of-crud-started (space to get started) === master
- r-of-crud-completed (implemented)
- c-of-crud-started (space to get started (has a form, no mutation))
- c-of-crud-completed (implemented)
- d-of-crud-started (space to get started, has a PostRow, delete link, no mutation)
- d-of-crud-completed (implemented)
- u-of-crud-started (space to get started, has an edit link that toggles between edit mode, no mutation)
- u-of-crud-completed (implemented)
- crud-complete (all done!)
